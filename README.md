kernel-of-truth
===============

A simple kernel written in C.

The goal of this project is to build a simple kernel with memory protection and iterrupts which can run
simple programs.
In addition I will experiment with alternate implementations of conversion functions and strings.
This project currently targets the i586 architecture. Perhaps someday I will port it to ARM so it can 
run on the Raspberry Pi, but right now I'm focused on implementing the fundamentals of system.
